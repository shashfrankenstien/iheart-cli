iHeart Radio
================

Command line client for `iHeartRadio <https://www.iheart.com/>`_

|Python 3.6| |license|


This project is meant to be a learning exercise. It is heavily inspired by `pianobar <https://github.com/PromyLOPh/pianobar>`_ which I love!

The project is a cross platform iHeartRadio console client implemented in Python. It is simply an alternative to playing iHeartRadio on the browser; only plays Live and Artist radio stations which are available without needing to create an account.

Features
---------------------

* Play Live and Artist radio stations
* Play Song radio stations (Which are essentially Artist stations, but created using song names)
* Save song urls into local playlists maintained as json files
    - Each playlist is saved as a separate json file and can be freely copied between machines
    - Play songs in a playlist sequentially or on shuffle

* Play `aNONradio <https://anonradio.net/>`_

Dependencies
